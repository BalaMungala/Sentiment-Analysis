Performing Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning( 6 Algorithms) and Neural Networks  in Python

MACHINE LEARNING:

  Performing Sentiment Analysis using SIX Maching Learning Algorithms.They are:
      1)Logistic Regression
      2)K-Nearest Neighbors
      3)Naive-Bayes
      4)Support Vector Machine
      5)DecisionTree
      6)Random Forest
      
By training with above Algorithms , we have to choose best Algorithm based on
      1)Accuracy
      2)Precision
      3)Recall
      4)f1_score
      5)auc(Area under curve)
      
we dont finalize based on one test set, so apply cross validation then apply above ,metrics to evaluate model performance,if model performance is not good then we have to go for "GRID SEARCH CV" which is used for "TUNING PARAMETERS" , by training with different parameters ,we get best parameters based on above metrics ,then keep that parameters in choosed algorithm then deploy the algorithm for production
